# Happy Company

Happy Company is a really simple Ruby on Rails application that will help you to measure happiness in your work environment.

## Roles

### Regular user

Can register, log in, edit profile and answer a question about how he/she feels about past day at work.

### Administrator

Admin can mange users and groups. He can also generate statistics for groups, parent groups and users.

## Answers

There is only one question "Are you happy today?" with four possible answers:
- Yes, I'm very happy about this day :D (score 3)
- Yes, this day was nice :) (score 2)
- No, it was an average day for me :/ (score 1)
- No, this day was a big disappointment :( (score 0)

## Statistics

Can be displayed for a specific period of time (last week, last month) or custom range. Admin can choose if he/she want to display only a specific person, whole group or few groups that are nested within parent group.

## Groups

Administrator can create regular group or parent group. User can be only assigned to regular group. Parent groups are used for statistics purposes. For example you can create a structure like this:

Legend:<br/>
PG (name) - parent group<br/>
G (name) - regular group<br/>
name - user

- PG (Rooms)
    - G (200)
        - Irek
        - Tomek
        - Arek
    - G (201)
        - Bartek
        - Rafał
    - G (202)
        - Błażej
        - Szymon
    - G (203)

        - Grzegorz

## Set up development environment

I suppose that you already have rails and rvm on your machine :)<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/kayinrage/happy_company.git`<br/>
create `.ruby-gemset` (for example with content: `hc`)<br/>
create `.ruby-version` (for example with content: `2.1.0`)<br/>
reload directory and then bundle<br/>
create `database.yml` (you can refer to `config/database_example.yml`)<br/>
`rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`<br/>
and you are ready to work :)<br/>
